# Vision (v0.6)

Greentic pack documentation is centered on the canonical component v0.6 path:

- build deterministic `.gtpack` bundles from `pack.yaml`
- use `greentic-pack doctor` for inspection/validation
- use `greentic-pack resolve` for explicit component resolution and lockfiles
- use `greentic-pack plan` for deployment planning

## Scope

Primary docs (`README.md`, `docs/usage.md`, `docs/cli.md`) teach v0.6-first workflows.
Legacy and compatibility behavior is documented separately in:

- `docs/vision/legacy.md`

## Deprecation policy

Legacy aliases and compatibility shims remain available for migration continuity,
but new guidance and examples should use canonical names and commands only.
