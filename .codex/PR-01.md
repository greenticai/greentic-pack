PR-01 — Add Flow Resolve Sidecar Support (Read-only) + Pack Lock Model

Goal: Introduce the new file formats without changing build behavior.

Scope

Add parsing/writing helpers for:

*.ygtc.resolve.json (from greentic-types FlowResolveV1)

pack.lock.json v1 (local model in greentic-pack for now, or import from greentic-types if added there)

Add “discovery” logic:

find all flows

compute sidecar path for each flow

read sidecar if present

emit warnings if missing (but do not fail)

Deliverables

PackLockV1 structs + serde JSON read/write (deterministic output)

FlowResolveV1 import + read helper

Unit tests:

read/write lockfile roundtrip

parse sidecar fixtures (local + oci + repo + store)

Docs: short section explaining the files

✅ End state: No behavior change, build stays as-is, tests pass.
