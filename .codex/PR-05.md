PR-05 — Sidecar enforcement + generation in update (if missing)

Goal: Make the system deterministic: build fails if resolve mapping missing; update can create sidecars.

Scope

Update command ensures:

if a flow exists but sidecar missing → create empty sidecar

if sidecar exists but missing node mapping → warn (or optionally error with --strict)

Build fails if:

flow nodes exist that cannot be resolved to a component source via sidecar

Deliverables

greentic-pack update writes sidecars when absent

--strict option that enforces “no unmapped nodes”

Tests:

update creates sidecar

build fails on unmapped nodes with actionable error

✅ End state: tooling can’t “guess”; it’s explicit and stable.
