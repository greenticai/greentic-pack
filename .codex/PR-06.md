PR-06 — UX polish + docs + integration examples

Goal: Finish the product experience.

Scope

Improve error messages (“missing pack.lock.json → run greentic-pack resolve”)

Ensure doctor output includes component resolution info:

show components inline vs remote, digests, and whether cache mode used

Docs:

“refs-only vs cache”

“sidecar always present”

recommended workflow for CI and offline

✅ End state: docs + CLI ergonomics are strong.
